The map, filter and reduce are essentially just some of the most well-known, easy to use, higher-order functions that run provided callback on each element of an array.

All the inbuilt methods are part of Array Prototype and they can can access the array thatâ€™s calling the function by referring to the current scope. 

While we all know how to use these methods, it has become a common practice in javascript interviews to ask the candidates to write their own implementation of these functions.
